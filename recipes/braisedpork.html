    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2lb pork belly</li>
        <li>1 cup fried shallots</li>
        <li>1/4 cup regular soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp five spice powder</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chinese cooking wine</li>
        <li>2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup fried shallots</li>
        <li>8 eggs (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Hand chop pork belly into small stripes, YES, hand-chopped pork belly, a lot of manual work, but trust me, it is worth it! You want to have a little bit of skin, fat, and meat in each slice (Refer to the video tutorial for more information)</li>
        <li>Saute in the Instant Pot for 2-3 minute or until it is no longer pink </li>
        <li>Add in soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, five-spice powder, sugar, and mix </li>
        <li>Pour in 2 cups of water and set the instant pot to “pressure cook” for 20 minute</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, quick release and add in 1 cup of fried dried shallots. Mix well to ensure everything is combined.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook for another 15 minutes and let it natural release </li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: if you want to make marinated eggs, instead of natural release, do a quick release and add in 8 peels of hard-boiled eggs and let it simmer for another 30 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
